The  top 3 salespeople accounted for close to 50% of the sales revenue, outperforming others in all the sales regions.

Analysis shows Europe companies had their orders shipped by American companies, even if the Goods were manufactured in Europe. Overall, more than $200,000.00 order worth, were shipped by American shippers from and to Europe. Had the company established distribution in Europe, it would have saved a fraction of that money, as well as reduced risk and delivery time.

Products with Gift boxes underperforming. It is understandable why the company wants to be eco-friendly. The material used in gift boxes and the quality of the boxes have left customers wondering. Research has shown that 94% of customers will buy products with the Recycle Logo on the boxes. I have a detailed report on how to enhance these gift boxes. Campaigns can be targeted toward eco-conscious regions and emerging markets. Research indicates a growing trend in demand for eco-friendly products, particularly packaging boxes, confirming positive market response and supporting the case for scaling sustainable packaging solutions, which would boost general sales and improve revenue
